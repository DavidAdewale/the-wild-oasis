# THE WILD OASIS 🏨

## About this project:

- 'The Wild Oasis' is a small boutique hotel with 8 luxurious wooden cabins.
- They need a custom built application to manage everything about the hotel: bookings, cabins and guests.
- This is the internal application used inside the hotel to check in guests as they arrive
- They have nothing right now, so they also need the API
- Later they will probably want a customer-facing website as well, where customers will be able to book stays using the same API

## Business Requirements and Features:

- Users of the app are hotel employees. They need to be logged into the application to perform tasks.
- New users can only be signed up inside the applications (to gurantee that only actual hotel employees can get accounts)
- Users should be able to upload an avatar, and change their name and password
- App needs a table view with all cabins, showing the cabin photo, name, capacity, price and current discount
- The booking status can be 'unconfimed' (booked but not yet checked in), "checked in", or "checked out". The table should be filterable by this important status
- Other booking data includes: number of guests, number of nights, guest observations, whether they booked breakfast, breakfast price.
- Users should be able to delete, check in, or check out a booking as the guest arrives (no editing is necessary for now)
- Bookings may not have been paid yet on guest arrival. Therefore, on check in, users need to accept payment (outside the app), and then confirm payment has been received (inside the app).
- On check in, the guest should have the ability to add breakfast for the entire stay, if they hadn't already.
- Guest data should contain: full name, email, national ID, nationality, and a country flag for easy identification
- The inital app scren should be a dashboard, to display important information for the last 7,30 and 90 days:
- A list of guest checking in and out on the current day. Users should be able to perform these tasks from here
- Statistics on recent bookings, sales, check ins, and occupancy rate
- A chart showing all daily hotel sales, showing both 'total' sales and 'extras' sales (only breakfast at the moment)
- A chart showing all statistics on stay durations, as this is an important metric for the hotel
- Users should be able to define a few application-wide settings: breakfast price, min and max nights/booking, max guests/booking
- App needs a dark mode
